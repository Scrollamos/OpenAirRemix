# OpenAirRemix
I have altered a couple of functions of openair deweathering Carslaw package with the intent of being able to micromanage hyperparameters a bit better.

I am but a simple peasant and while Im fairly proficient in C and python, I heavily used chatgpt to help me carve these functions in Rstudio.
